      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 1, 2013</p>
      <p>We collect certain information through our website, located a www.iowammp.com (our "Website"). This page (this "Privacy Policy") lays out our policies and procedures surrounding the collection and handling of any such information that identifies an individual user or that could be used to contact or locate him or her ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII").</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies only our Website. It does not apply to any third party site or service linked to our Website or recommended or referred by our Website or by our staff. And it does not apply to any other website or online service operated by our company, or to any of our offline activities.</p>
      
      <h2>A. PII We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the following Personally Identifiable Information from users who buy our products and services: name, e-mail address, telephone number, address, and land information.</p>
      <p>We also use "cookies" to collect certain information from all users, including website visitors who don't buy anything through our Website. A cookie is a string of data our system sends to your computer and then uses to identify your computer when you return to our Website. Cookies give us usage data, like how often you visit, where you go at the site, and what you do.</p>
      
      <h2>B. Our Use of PII</h2>
      <p>We use your Personally Identifiable Information to create your account, to communicate with you about products and services you've purchased, to offer you additional products and services, and to bill you. We also use that information to the extent necessary to enforce our Website terms of service and to prevent imminent harm to persons or property.</p>
      <p>We use cookies so that our Website can remember you and provide you with the information you're most likely to need. For instance, when you return to our Website, cookies identify you and prompt the site to provide your username (not your password), so you can sign in more quickly. Cookies also allow our Website to remind you of your past purchases and to suggest similar products and services. Finally, we use information gained through cookies to compile statistical information about use of our Website, such as the time users spend at the site and the pages they visit most often. Those statistics do not include PII.</p>
      
      <h2>C. Contractor and Other Third Party Access to PII</h2>
      <p>We give certain independent contractors access to Personally Identifiable Information. Those contractors assist us with the maintenance of our databases. All those contractors are required to sign contracts in which they promise to protect PII using procedures equivalent to ours. (Users are not third party beneficiaries of those contracts.) We also may disclose PII to attorneys, collection agencies, or law enforcement authorities to address contract violations or illegal behavior. And we disclose any information demanded in a court order or otherwise required by law or to prevent imminent harm to persons or property.</p>
      <p>As noted above, we compile Website usage statistics from data collected through cookies. We may publish those statistics or share them with third parties, but they don't include PII.</p>
      
      <h2>D. Accessing and Correcting Your PII</h2>
      <p>You can access and change any Personally Identifiable Information we store through your "My Account" page.</p>
      
      <h2>E. Amendment of this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new version on this page or on a successor page. The new version will become effective on the date it's posted, which will be listed at the top of the page as the new Effective Date.</p>
